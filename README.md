# credit-risk-classification

## Overview of the module 
The aim of this module was to use the machine learning skills we had learned from the previous week and using it to forcast credit risks. The dataset was made up of financial details of loans from various borrowers. This type of work is essential for banks to see which customers should be given loans and mortages 

There were two variables in this challenge: high risk and healthy, each one denoted who was more likely to defaul on a loan. 

The machine learning (ML) progress involved multiple steps such as processing the data, training the models and seeing the performance of the models. A logistic regression model was used on the data and a random oversampling was applied to adress the variations in the data. Using this resampled dataset, antoher logistic regression model was done on it. In addition, other things such as balenced accuracry was applied to see how well the model performed. 

## Results of the model 
The model results found that there was an increase in performance from .944 to .996 after the model data was redone. The recall for high risk loans was 1 after ROS was performed which is good for institutions that wnat to use the model to minimize losses for high risk loans. The ROS corrected for the imbalenced data. 

## Conclusion 
The second model is better and more accurate then the first model because it has better performance. The second model can identify high risk loans better which is what banks rely on to minimize losses and maximize profits.
